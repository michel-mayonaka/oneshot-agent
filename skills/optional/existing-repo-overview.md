# Existing Repository Overview Skill

When working in an existing repository:

- First, scan the project structure (top-level dirs, main entrypoints, tests).
- Identify the primary runtime path for the feature you will touch.
- Prefer aligning with existing patterns and libraries instead of introducing new ones.
- Before editing, summarise your understanding of the current design in the worklog.
- After changes, explain how to run tests or checks to validate your edits.
